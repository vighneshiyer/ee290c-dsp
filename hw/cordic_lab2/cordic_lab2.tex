\section{Type Generic CORDIC}
I genericified my CORDIC and found that at least \textbf{27 stages} were required for the \verb|DspReal| version to achieve 2 LSB precision.

I think my usage of typeclasses was excessive, but I just kept adding what was needed to get the code to compile. Is there a way to alias a conjunction of typeclasses like

\begin{minted}{scala}
typeclass CORDICNumber = Data : Ring : BinaryRepresentation : ConvertableTo : Order
\end{minted}
