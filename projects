- OFDM software radio (LTE,WIFI) / MIMO (Massive)
- Bluetooth Modem (low power, BTLE)
- GPS receiver (differential?)
- SmartNIC (........, there are no real ideas here (that work with the existing RISC-V infra), except generic hardware offloading)
- Wellness monitor
- SDR with configurable hardware signal processing chain

What I want to work on:
- SDR with programmable data flow chain (hardened blocks with some programmability) and use them to create various radio processing chains
    - NoC for inter-block communication
    - Hook with Rocket cores (for synchronization and blocks which can't be offloaded into HW) and DRAM endpoints
    - FPGA prototype which can stream IQ samples and even do in-circuit emulation with a SDR RF frontend (antenna, LNA, ADC w/ SERDES)
    - Specific application to get working: atomic radio reception from WWVB, generic TX/RX (no protocol), Bluetooth
    - FPGA <-> FPGA proof of concept (low frequency AM, FSK, PSK, BPSK, QPSK, QAM) generic transmission
    - Look at GNURadio flow graphs for ideas on common ways blocks are assembled and what computation is involved
